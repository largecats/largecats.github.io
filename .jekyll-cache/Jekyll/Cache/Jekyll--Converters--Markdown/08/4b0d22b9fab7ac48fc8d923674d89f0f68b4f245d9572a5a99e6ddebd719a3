<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>

<p>I want to insert an image in a blog post in a way that is consistent when viewing it locally and after pushing it to GitHub. This means I cannot use absolute path. Also, I do not want to use another online drive to store my pictures. This means I cannot use an url of the image. That leaves me with using relative path.</p>
