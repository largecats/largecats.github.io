<p>I was updating my backup drive and needed to delete some huge folders on that drive. Deleting large folders in Windows explorer could take quite a while because Windows would first calculate the folderâ€™s size, which is time-consuming. Therefore, it would be great to know how to quickly delete huge folders on Windows.</p>
