<p>I wondered how movies at <a href="https://movie.douban.com/">Douban</a> compare to those at <a href="https://www.imdb.com/">IMDb</a>. I also wanted to learn web scraping as it was a required skill for a course I was going to take the following semester (otherwise I would have gone with API). So I decided to use web scraping to collect data on the top 250 movies at Douban and those at IMDb and do some comparative analyses.</p>

<p>I read <a href="https://www.dataquest.io/blog/web-scraping-beautifulsoup/">this article</a> about BeautifulSoup.</p>
