This was the winter break of 2017/18. I wondered how movies at [Douban](https://movie.douban.com/) compare to those at [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/). I also wanted to learn web scraping as it was a required skill for a course I was going to take the following semester. So I decided to use web scraping to collect data on the top 250 movies at Douban and those at IMDb and do some comparative analyses.
