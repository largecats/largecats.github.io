## Problem

I recently installed Anaconda 3 with Python 3.6.8. Calling `matplotlib.pylot` raises the error
```
This application failed to start because it could not find or load the Qt platform plugin "windows" in "" 
Reinstalling the application may fix this problem. 
```



## Solution

Type
```
pip install pyqt5
```
in Anaconda prompt.
